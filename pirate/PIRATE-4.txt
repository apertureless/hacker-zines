                               ** WHO ARE WE? **
 
We've been asked "who are you guys?" Well, the guys are not all guys, and
sexism sucks. The people who put out pirate are mostly IBMers with some apple
and ST influences. We're a loose collective, mostly from the midwest, but with
contributors from around the country. Collectively, we're on probably all of
the good national boards, and those listed as "contact points" are not
necessarily those we frequent the most, but those we like a lot and where we
check in at least once every few weeks. Our goal is to try to provide news of
general interest to *all* BBS enthusiasts, share information and gossip, and to
give newcomers tips on how not to be lame. We hope this will improve BBSing for
everybody. We are committed to keeping information free to the people, and we
oppose control of knowledge by an elite few. As warez hobbyits, we believe that
knowledge of current software is of benefit to the software industry despite
their claim that sharing is unethical. We also believe that informed consumers
make for better products, and that sharing information on warez is a patriotic
and democratic duty.
 
As some may notice, the format of *PIRATE* changes each issue, for the better,
we hope. We have noticed some *PIRATE* files listed as g-philes on some boards,
so we thought it might be helpful to include an index periodically of previous

(From the CHICAGO SUN-TIMES 2/7/90)
 
         Two students with reputations as master computer hackers were
indicted here Tuesday on charges of stealing and publishing highly sensitive
information about the 911 emergency phone system in nine southern states. The
indictment alleges Robert J.  Riggs, 20, a student at DeVry Institute in
suburban Atlanta, is a member of "The Legion of Doom," a nationwide group of
hackers said to be involved in illegal activities. His co-defendant is Craig
M. Neidorf, 19, a University of Missouri student who publishes Phrack, a
hacker magazine transmitted by computer. The indictment charges Riggs gained
unauthorized access to computers of the Bell South Telephone Co. in Atlanta in
December, 1988, and obtained the 911 file. It was sent to Neidorf via a
computer bulletin board in Lockport.

2 STUDENTS CHARGED IN COMPUTER FRAUD
------------------------------------
 
(from the Chicago Tribune 2/7/90)
 
         Two college students who were members of a nationwide network of
computer hackers called the Legion of Doom were charged Tuesday with
breaking into the BellSouth Corp. 911 emergency system and publishing the
system through a hackers' "bulletin board."
 
         Robert J. Riggs, 20, a DeVry Institute student in Atlanta, and Craig
Neidorf, 19, a University of Missouri student from Chesterfield, Mo., were
charged with wire fraud, interstate transportation of stolen property and
computer fraud and abuse.
 
         The indictment, announced in Chicago by U.S. Atty. Ira Raphealson,
charges that Riggs broke into the BellSouth system in December 1988 "by using
a computer outside the telephone company to break into the telephone company's
computer system in which the computer file was stored."
 
         The computer program for the BellSouth 911 system, valued at $79,449,
controls emergency calls in nine Southern states - Alabama, Mississippi,
Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Florida.
 
         Riggs then transfered the BellSouth 911 information to the computer
"bulletin board" in Lockport. At this point, Neidorf loaded it into his
computer in Missouri and edited it for publication in a computer hacker
publication known as "Phrack," the indictment charges.
 
         Assistant U.S. Atty. William Cook, who prepared the indictment,
declined to say if the police or fire departments in any of the affected citie
 
         If convicted of all charges, Riggs would face a prison sentence of
32 years and a fine of $220,000. Neidorf faces 31 years in prision and a
fine of $122,000. Riggs faces similar charges in Atlanta, Cook said.
 
--------------------------------------
 
Whats interesting about this is what they are charging Craig (Knight Lightning)
with. it appears publishing the information (based on prision time) is nearly
as criminal as breaking in and getting the program. its unlikely that either
one will serve much time if any at all but it does present a crimp into what
can be 'published' and what cannot on bulletin boards.
 
what the article did not mention or name is the board in Lockport. i take it
they are taking about Lockport Illinios which i'm unfamilar with which board
this could be. although they have indicted 2 people, one who sent the info and
one who took it, does that mean the bbs used for the transfer is out of the
picture so to speak?
 
much food for thought....

Name: Magnum Guru
Date: Sat Jan 20 02:58:54 1990
 
Welp, Phrack magazine is dead. Those of you who pay attention to BITNET know
that the phrack accounts at U of M have been shut down. The story is as
follows...
 
Government agents (not sure of the dept., probably SS) have apparently been
monitoring the e-mail of the Phrack kids (Night Thunder & Prince Tarzan) for
some time now. Apparently, a portion of a file sent to them (and subsequently
published) contained copyrighted information. This is all they needed. They
have now seized the entire Phrack net mailing list (over 500 accounts), plus
every piece of information that Andar & Geric have (and they have a *LOT*) on
real names, addresses and phone numbers.  This is evolving directly out of the
busts of three LOD members (Urvile, Leftist & Prophet). The Prophet (who is on
probation) is apparently being threatened with a prison term if he doesn't
cooperate. We don't know for sure if he cooperated or not, but what would you
do in the same position?  The same officials are apparently *VERY* interested
in our co-sys, Mr. BA. His net account is being watched, etc. I'll let
him tell the story.
 
   Anyone wishing to communicate with E or myself should do so through the
board only. I will be adding a secure (and I mean fucking secure) encryption
routine into the e-mail in the next 2 weeks - I haven't decided exactly how to
implement it, but it'll let two people exchange mail encrypted by a password
only know to the two of them. Hmmmm... carry this conversation to the
programming board.
 
Anyway, I do not think I am due to be busted, but then again, I don't do
anything but run a board. Still, there is that possibility. I assume that my
lines are all tapped until proven otherwise.
 
There is some question to the wisdom of leaving the board up at all, but I have
(have) personally phoned several government investigators and invited them to
join us here on the board. If I begin to feel that the board is putting me in
any kind of danger, I'll pull it down with no notice - I hope everyone
understands.
 
It looks like it's sweeps-time again for the feds. Let's hope all of us are
still around in 6 months to talk about it.

RE: phrack...
 
I sounds to me as though the "SS" was really reaching.  I mean, to get them on
"copyright" violations is sort of like that had such a hard on for the
Phrack boys it was as though they went after gangsters with income tax evasion!
 
What is the legality of them spreading all of this information that they have
obtained throughout the world?  I mean, if they got names, etc.., isn't that
private information?  Do they or wl they publish all of it to the maniacs out
there?
 
35/53: Phrack and Pac*Hell
Name: Rip Torn
Date: Sat Jan 20 21:05:55 1990
 
Well-
 
A copyright infringement isn't all that major that the SS would bust them for
just that.  I'm willing to bet they intercepted something bigger than a simple
copyright piracy case.  Although they would be interested since the information
is being transported across state (and quite likly) national boundries.
 
About the San Jose case, sounds like they just got access to the TAN (Technical
Access Network), and went from there.  Along with their other antics, they'll
prob get a prison term, because they are really strict on the wiretap bit.  I
don't get the part about the false names and addresses.  The courts have said
in the past, you can just pick a name out of the blue and use it, and you can
give any kind of information (like a false address or phone number for
instance) as long as the documentation is not for an official purpose and is
not intended to defraud someone.
 
I noticed Peter Neumann in there, he's a guy to listen to, and many of you
might reconize him from the Risks forum on the net.  He is one of the few
public figures involved in computers that knows which way is up.
 
Recap-
 
Phrack will most likly get a slap on the wrist, but will have a sober look at
the world, and won't be inclined to be as high profile as they were.
 
The San Jose case, I'm betting it'll turn high profile, and there will be alot
of pressure for a nice long lock up.
 
Most of this is based on my dealings with local, state, and federal law, as
well as experience I gain while working for the County of San Diego.

I would think they knew of dealings between phrack & hackers/phreakers, but
they had to have some real evidence in order to get in, once they did, they
found much info that would make for a good prosecution... As any hacker knows,
its the little things that matter
 
37/53: The Bottom line.
Name: The Rap Master
Date: Sun Jan 21 10:05:38 1990
 
    The bottom line is..a crackdown.  We can now expect a crackdown because of
the shit with the virus,the boys in cali, and the phrack kids.... The phrack
boys were just the start, i'm sure of it.. Unfortunately with all of this in
the news now, they will be able to get more government money to combat hackers.
And thats BAD fucking news for us.  I think they are going after all the
"teachers" etc/.. people who educate others into this sort of thing.. (which i
didn't need to say because it's obvious after what happened to Andar & Geric) i
wonder if they think that maybe these remote cases are linked in any way.. The
only way they can probably see is that we are hackers.. And so that is where
their energies will be put.. To stop ALL hackers..and stop people BEFORE they
can become a threat.. After they wipe out the educators that is.  Just a
theory.
 
38/53: Phrack
Name: Phobos Kutter
Date: Sun Jan 21 13:09:20 1990
 
It's a scary thought... - How did the intercept the information?? -
 
An information, ok, that's legal.... but how private is electronic mail?  Per
haps we need a sub board to discuss some of these LEGAL issues...
 
39/53: ripper
Name: Magnum Guru
Date: Sun Jan 21 17:12:22 1990
 
Well, I know PT & NT pretty well, and they've been paranoid about doing
*anything* illegal. I think the SS just had a hard-on to hassle them and this
was the only excuse that they could come up with...
 
41/53: Phrack
Name: The Mogul
Date: Mon Jan 22 01:19:32 1990
 
I'm not sure what to make out of the Phrack.  I think the SS, FBI, and whoever
has been waiting to bust them so long on ANYTHING that they waiting untill PT
NT crossed the line in any way.  I mean, hell..PT and NT were paranoid, and
they suspected everything..so they stopped..and the SS, FBI and whoever had
nothing to go on...
 
Rap Master was right, PT and NT were "educators"..a lot of hacks/phreaks looked
up to them..maybe the SS and FBI thought that maybe if they couldn't get the
little guys, then to go for "the big guys"..(same philosophy of the drug war,
eh?  Get the dealers, not the users?)  Oh well..
 
I dunno..thats just my opinion... Shit, the public doesn't understand us enough
for the government to declare war on us...  Maybe if you collect everyones
opinion on this, we can come to ONE conclusion..
 
 
42/53: Phrack
Name: Viking Warrior
Date: Mon Jan 22 02:40:13 1990
 
Geric was very upset when I talked to him a few days ago.
 
The Secret Service had been to their school and had taken all information off
of their public accounts through the university...this included the ENTIRE
phrack internet mailing list, future files, old issues, various lists of info
on people they knew, etc...
 
Geric assured me that they didn't go through his room, or even mess with his
pc, but that didn't matter, as they got enough from the system at school.
 
The problems stem from various articles published through Phrack, most
specifically an article dealing with E911 that was written by The Prophet.
They have said that this was stolen from a computer system, and was accepted
and distributed knowing that it was illegally obtained propriatary information.
 
(The Prophet was one of the 3 LOD members busted this summer in Atlanta)  This
led to various questions dealing with LOD in general and a great deal of hazing
towards Geric.
 
For the most part, they pulled the same crap:  "We know what you did, so if
you're smart you'll talk, or we'll make your life shit."  And the other
approach, "Look, we know you're a smart kid with a bright future and we really
 wouldn't want to see you fuck things up."  Basic cop bullshit.
 
Geric was visited first by 3 agents, and Andar was supposedly to be visited the
following day.  (They are at different schools now)
 
They were interested in the Telenet Directory, The EFT Files, which by now,
everyone knows that I wrote, since they had been grabbing the boys e-mail.
 
That pisses me off greatly, as Electronic Mail is supposed to be covered under
the same protection as regular mail now, or so I understood.  I thought it was
a felony to interfere with peoples mail.  Can you commit a felony, to stop a
suspected one from occurring?  I hope not...hell, maybe Noriega is in charge
now...
 
In any case, I think I'm in for a world of shit...
 
43/53: MY feelings about this fucked up situation
Name: Viking Warrior
Date: Mon Jan 22 03:31:01 1990
 
I do not live in a fascist country...or so I thought.
 
INformation is withheld, people are threatened daily by an elite group of
Government thugs who operate above the law, hell, what do you call that kind of
bullshit?
 
I'm growing more and more pissed by the minute...if I do get nabbed, which I
semi-expect to, so you SS boys take a good look at this, I am dangerous.  Maybe
not in a physical manner, although I'm kinda suicidal, and don't know how I'll
be on any given day, and I've only tried to kill my roommate once with a big
knife, and I've only broken wine bottles over two people...
 
But, I am dangerous in that I'm quite eloquent and VERY outspoken on topics
about which I feel strongly.  Guess what?  I kinda have a personal leaning
towards computer crime.  Think carefully about reprocussions world-wide when
reporters find out just how insecure your precious Internet is, or think about
the stock fluctuations on Fortune 500 companies when their shareholders find
out just how easily the company could be shut down for a few days with a few
keystrokes, or consider the implications following just a few choice comments
about the lack of security at large banking institutions...hell, How fucking
skilled does someone have to be to sit on a nua and capture every fucking Saudi
Visa?  (No offense P) but that shit is totally ridiculous.  Security is
pathetic, and the ones who can fix it, or at least point it out are suppressed,
and placed in jail.
 
Fuck that.  If that's what you expect to do to me, then you had better be
prepared to blow my fucking head off when you kick in the door, because I will
be heard.

as long as nothing illegal is not posted.. the board is ine.. well... All i
have to say is that i ss/eds/or in my case CIA start playing dirty.. we have
been very nice in general about everything.. In act I cannot think o any time
when i have bought a system down.. But i it comes to it... we can fight ire
with ire.. <add f's where chars are missing.. i gotta get a new keyboard..> coz
i seriously agree with erik.. and when you guys start breaking the law to get
at us... well.. what the hell is the law or... i never liked the damn thing
anyway.. jesus.. as a final note... i will set up some sort of insurance... not
just or myself... but or anyone who needs it... and cant provide it or
themselves.. we can play below board just as much as any authorities can... so
there

Kill 'em all..as I like to say.  Seriously, what can they prove if you are a
safe hacker?  (hacking via outdials, phreaking with divertors only..no codes
etc.  nothing traceable)  They can't prove a damn thing.  So what do they do,
but nail you on something trivial like copyright violation.  All that shows is
that they have such a weak case that there is nothing solid to bust on.  Enough
rambling for this paragraph...
 
What we need to do is set up a hackers network where everyone has their hands
in a few systems.  That way, we have this sort of insurance that Phoenix talked
about:  if one hacker gets busted 2 systems _die_.  2 hackers get busted 4
systems bite the dust.  3 hackers...9 systems.  They need to quit messing with
people who wouldn't otherwise be harmful to the computer world.  I know there
are freeloaders around that get their kicks from trashing Apple][ boards and
unixes, but this doesn't represent the majority of the hacker population.  It
sure doesn't represent me!
 
50/53: busts

Date: Mon Jan 22 15:33:56 1990
 
I don't think that would be a very wise idea... It would just cause the
"authorities" and the general public to look toward us as destroyers, not
explorers... The ONLY times I have killed a system is when I really get pissed
off that the sysop keeps changing all the operator passwords (well... so maybe
i am a little malicious at times, but not like some people on this board)

Wiping out systems as a means of retribution, or vengeance for a fellow
hacker's bust is NOT a good idea.  You cannot take a bully approach when
dealing with the world biggest bully (The US Government)  you will lose.
You have only one manner of defense, and that is to outsmart your opponent, or
to publicly humiliate him when faced with immediate danger.

Reading the previous msgs. about the legion of doom and the possible prison
term of 32 years infuriates me.  sure, what those dudes did is not right, but
lets keep their crime in perspective.  they stole some shit off of a computer
system which was online and available to the public.  ok, most of the public
doesn't know how to get stuff like that, but the fact that they did get it
means it could be considered available.  the phone company surely knows of
phreakers, and that these people can be quite clever, therefore they knew the
information could be had.
 
30 years in jail for a fucking program, come on!!!  people are killed and the
murderers get less.  i realize that they probably won't get 30 years, but just
the possibility of getting it is outrageous.

    32 years for printing a publication. Hey you guys think there is some
issues of freedon of press or speech here. No probabably not because of the
subject matter but anyway It does seem kind of harsh considering there are alo
of other more important things to bust assholes for like murder and drug
smuggling. Its just another waste of tax payers money just like trying to
eleminate abortion. Who gives a fuck if you can't bring a kid into this world
right then there should be a choice. Too many people in this world anyway.

A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF "NOT COMPLAINING UNLESS YOUR OX IS GORED"!  NOW I AGREE
WITH YOU THAT 32 YEARS, OR ANY YEARS FOR PUBLISHING IS RIDICULOUS...PER THE
FIRST AMENDMENT, BUT THEN YOU GO ON ABOUT MURDER AND "DRUG SMUGGLING" IN THE
SAME BREATHE.  SINCE WHEN DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE THE RIGHT TO TELL US WHAT
WE CAN AND CAN'T DO WITH OUR BODIES IN PRIVATE?  SINCE WHEN DOES THAT

The prison sentence..or the one that they face is quite high! That is more
than they give murderers/rapists and any other hard crime! I'm not saying that

I don't think they're actually being PROSECUTED for publishing the information
they just play up the fact that the information was distributed in their cop
press releases to build public antipathy towards the suspects... Generic peopl
tend to think very highly of things like 911 that shouldn't be "monkeyed with"
so when they hear that kids are spreading "confidential" information about
those systems around, they get afraid and are sympathetic to prosecution.  The
only charges I can imagine are related to 'breaking and entering' into the
Bellcore computer.
 
To the best of my knowledge, there is no precedent for a "clear and present
danger" prosecution against publication of information on law enforcement
procedures.  A successful one, anyway.
 
                                * * * * * * *
 
The following came across the wires from a member of LoD explaining his view,
which contrasts remarkably from "official" media descriptions. The bottom line
is that it seems like the pheds are engaging in a witch hunt of sorts and
whether they can make charges stick is irrelevant for the Heavy Hasslers with
the power.
 
 
--------------------
 
 
                         -< Life, The Universe, & LOD >-
 
 
To set the record straight, a member of LOD who is a student in Austin and who
has had his computer account at UT subpoenaed by the DA out of Chicago because
of dealings with the above happenings:
 
My name is {deleted}, but to the computer world, I am Erik Bloodaxe.  I have
been a member of the group known as Legion of Doom since its creation, and
admittedly I have not been the most legitimate computer user around, but when
people start hinting at my supposed Communist-backed actions, and say that I
am involved in a world-wide consipracy to destroy the nations computer and/or
911 network, I have to speak up and hope that people will take what I have to
say seriously.
 
Frank, Rob and Adam were all definately into really hairy systems.  They had
basically total control of a packet-switched network owned by Southern Bell
(SBDN)...through this network they had access to every computer Southern Bell
owned...this ranging from COSMOS terminals up to LMOS front ends.  Southern
Bell had not been smart enough to disallow connections from one public pad to
another, thus allowing anyone who desired to do so, the ability to connect to,
and seize information from anyone else who was using the network...thus they
ended up with accounts and passwords to a great deal of systems.
 
This was where the 911 system came into play.  I don't know if this system
actually controlled the whole Southern Bell 911 network, or if it was just a
site where the software was being developed, as I was never on it.  In any
case, one of the trio ended up pulling files off of it for them to look at.
This is usually standard proceedure: you get on a system, look around for
interesting text, buffer it, and maybe print it out for posterity.  No member
of LOD has ever (to my knowledge) broken into another system and used any
information gained from it for personal gain of any kind...with the exception
of maybe a big boost in his reputation around the underground.  Rob took the
documentation to the system and wrote a file about it.  There are actually two
files, one is an overview, the other is a glossary.  (Ray has the issue of
PHRACK that has the files) The information is hardly something anyone could
possibly gain anything from except knowledge about how a certain aspect of the
telephone company works.
 
The Legion of Doom used to publish an electronic magazine called the LOD
Technical Journal.  This publication was kind of abandoned due to laziness on
our part.  PHRACK was another publication of this sort, sent to several
hundred people over the Internet, and distributed widely on bulletin boards
around the US.  Rob sent the files to PHRACK for the information to be read.
One of PHRACK's editors, Craig, happened to be the one who received the files.
If Rob had sent the files to one address higher, Randy would have been the one
who would probably be in trouble.  In anycase, Craig, although he may have
suspected, really had no way to know that the files were propriatary
information and were stolen from a Southern Bell computer.
 
The three Atlanta people were busted after having voice and data taps on their
lines for 6 months.  The Phrack people were not busted, only questioned, and
Craig was indicted later.
 
What I don't understand is why Rob and Craig are singled out more often than
any other people.  Both of them were on probation for other incidents and will
probably end up in jail due to probation violations now.  Frank and Adam still
don't know what is going on with their cases, as of the last time I spoke with
them.
 
The whole bust stemmed from another person being raided and rolling over on
the biggest names he could think of to lighten his burden.  Since that time,
Mr. William Cook, the DA in Chicago, has made it his life's goal to rid the
world of the scourge of LOD.  The three Atlanta busts, two more LOD busts in
New York, and now, my Subpoena.
 
People just can't seem to grasp the fact that a group of 20 year old kids just
might know a little more than they do, and rather than make good use of us,
they would rather just lock us away and keep on letting things pass by them.
I've said this before, you cant stop burglars from robbing you when you leave
the doors unlocked and merely bash them in the head with baseball bats when
they walk in.  You need to lock the door.  But when you leave the doors open,
but lock up the people who can close them for you another burglar will just
walk right in.
 
If anyone really wants to know anything about what is going on or just wants
to offer any opinions about all this directly to me, I'm
 
erikb@walt.cc.utexas.edu
 
but my account is being monitored so don't ask anything too explicit.

***  >Zipping and Archiving<                     ***
***************************************************
 
 
Swapping warez requires considerable zipping, unzipping, and rezipping, and we
offer the following tips to help assure that we get the most out of our ZIP
programs and procedures. ALthough most boards will accept any reputable
compression, there's not much disagreement on which compression method is the
best: Phil Katz's PKZIP is the standard. It's fast, tight, and offers many
options.  Although some, such as ICE 1.14, may have higher compression ratios,
no other program has the all around power and utility as PKware.
Unfortunately, too many warez hobbyists don't use PKZIP to it's full potential,
and this can result in lost files, confused archives, or incomplete files on
uploading. We offer the following tips to improve zipping procedures.
 
1. Always zip from the original disks or programs when possible rather then do
a file dump and then rezip. In a file dump, it is easy to forget to include
subdirectories.
 
2. *ALWAYS* put a zip comment in each zip file so you (or others) know what
that file is. If you are zipping up a program called "LAWRITE" that has 6
disks, with the first being the program disk, type this command:
    PKZIP LRT21-1  (for "Law Rite, ver. 2.1, disk 1). Then, type:  PKZIP -Z
    LRT21-1   (this will allow a zip comment) and type at the prompt something
    like: "LAWRITE BY MACON, VER. 2.1, PROGRAM DISK  (1/6).  This lets you (or
    whoever) know what the program is, what the disk is should the installation
    procedure ask for the specific disk, and give you the version so it won't
    be confused with an upgrade.
 
3. Experienced hobbyists keep their backup zip files as they come
off the disk, and this means *KEEPING SUBDIRECTORIES INTACT AND SEPARATE FROM
OTHER FILES.**  There are two ways to do this.  The first is to INSTALL a
complete program, including all options, so a complete program exists on hard
disk. Then, we go into each subdirectory and zip the files. For example, if
LAWRITE has a main directory called LAWRITE and three subdirectories called a)
FILES, b) LAW, and c) DICTNRY, you first go into each of the three
subdirectories and zip the the files with the command:  PKZIP -M FILES (or LAW
or DICTNRY).  This will zip all the files in that directory and remove them
after zipping. This saves the need to delete files individually.  THEN: Go into
the LAWRITE directory and type the command:
  PKZIP -m -P -r LRT21 (note lower case m & r and UPPER case P)
This will zip the entire program, Law Rite 2.1. The -m command
removes individual files, the -P switch retains the file's original
path, and the -r recurses the subdirectories. For a helpful article on
this, even for experienced users, see Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols:
"Zippity PKzip" in PC COMPUTING, Feb., 1990 (p. 96-99).
 
When finished, you should have one main zip file that contains all the files
from the LAWRITE directory and three additional zip files from the three
subdirectories. BE SURE TO ADD A "README.NOW" note and explain that, when
unzipping, these directories and subdirectories should be created, unzipped in
the LAWRITE directory (with the PKUNZIP command). If you have a large program
with several zip files in it (ALWAYS RUN THE PKUNZIP -v *.zip command to see
what's in a zip file before unzipping), you might first create subdirectoriese
named after those zip files just to be safe, and keep your fingers crossed that
whoever zipped it knew what they were doing.  That's why it is crucial to name
those other zip files exactly as the subdirectory appears.
 
The disadvantage of this kind of zipping for hobbyists is that when unzipping,
the files will be from an installed program and not the original disk. This
means that if unzipped on a different computer, some needed files may be
missing. Besides, it's always helpful to have a second backup that
doesn't take much space that is complete. That's why we prefer
to keep zips off the original disks, because you never know what
kind of system it will be unzipped on, and installation programs
rarely copy over all files, but only those needed during the
initial configuration.
 
We suggest creating a test directory with a few subdirectories and placed some
short, unneeded files in them and then spending an hour practicing with the
PKzip/UNzip commands until you are familiar with them. You might also consider
experimenting with various batch commands, and use wildcards to create an
auto-zip program that saves typing time.
 
There have been reports that ICE 1.14 is a hacked version of LHarc, but this
does not appear true. A nice summary of other compression programs appeared in
PC COMPUTING (see above):
 
 ----------
FOUR OTHER DATA COMPRESSORS PKzip stands above other data-compression shareware
in terms of overall performance. Here are some more very popular utilities:
 
ARC 5.02. Long the industry standard, Arc 6.02 has deteriorated into a
middle-of-the-road performer in terms of speed and compression ratios.  It has
the bad habit of aborting a job and leaving a file half-compressed if it
doesn't have enough disk space to complete the operation....
 
ICE .14. One of the newest entries in the data-compression arena, Ice (also
known as LHarc) emerged as a popular shareware program in Japan.  It has the
highest compression ratio of any program mentioned here, but it's painfully
slow--and very difficult to use, in part because of its limited documentation.
Ice .14 is currently available on GEnie.
 
PAK 2.1.  Though it's been around for a while, Pak has never had the prominence
of either Arc or PKzip, mostly because its performance lags behind that of the
other two programs. Pak excels at handling multiple file specifications and can
create and convert files read by Arc.
 
Zoo 2.01. Neither the fastest nor the most efficient compression utility
available, Zoo offers some advantages. This shareware program allows you to
selectively extract multiple generations of the same file--a terrific feature
for programmers and writers. It also spans several operating systems, including
Xenix, VAX/VMS, and Amiga DOS, so that you can archive files across platforms.
It's a difficult program to master, and the documentation isn't much help in
figuring it out.

----------------------------------------------------------------
                    MINDSCAPES BOP'N WRESTLE
----------------------------------------------------------------
                             NEEDED:
1. Norton Utilities (or similar program)
2. A copy of the file Bop.exe from your original disk.
3. A bit of your time
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
1. HOW TO UNPROTECT BOP'N WRESTLE:
First load one of the above file into Norton.
Then search for the string B8 00 19 CD.
Change these bytes to 31 C0 EB 2F.
Save the changes
 
2. FOR ALL OF YOU DEBUG FANS:
Rename Bop.exe to Bop.try
type E CS:96D [return] 31 [space] C0 [space] EB [space] 2F
[return]
Save the changes with the W command
Exit debug
Rename Bop.try back to Bop.exe
Enjoy the game on any drive you choose to.
 
The program will now skip the check for copy protection all together. The first
change (31 C0) is an xor ax,ax. The Second (EB 2F) jumps to a return. (just in
case you wanted to know)
 
If you have any problems with any of the patches above check the date of the
file BOP.EXE on your original disk A for the date 11/06/87. If your file has a
different date then they probably changed the copy protection method and your
out of luck with this patch.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------
                                 **KARATEKA**
----------------------------------------------------------------
                             NEEDED:
Norton Utilities (or simular program).
A copy of the file Karateka.exe from your original disk.
A bit of your time.
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. HOW TO UNPROTECT BRODERBUND'S KARATEKA:
First load KARATEKA.EXE into Norton.
Then search for the string E8 81 14.
Change the string to 90 90 90.
Skip ahead 4 bytes to the string 75 2D.
Change the 75 to EB.
Search for the string E8 74 14.
Change the string to 90 90 90.
Once again skip ahead 4 bytes to the string 75 20 and Change the
75 to EB.
Write the changes.
The program will now skip over the part where it looks for the copy protection
but you aren't done yet.
Now search for the string B2 00 B4 0E CD 21.
Change all of these bytes to 90.
Write the changes.
Now the program will play on whatever drive you want.
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
If you have any problems with any of the patches above check the date of the
file KARATEKA.EXE on your original disk for the date 07-01-87. If your file has
a different date then they proabably changed the copy protection method and
your out of luck with this patch.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------

                      THE COMPANY OF WOLVES
----------------------------------------------------------------
                             NEEDED:
Norton Utilities (or simular program).
A copy of the game file from your original Manhunter disk.
IM2_CGA.EXE if you have CGA graphics,IM2_TAN.EXE for Tandy,
IM2_EGA.EXE for EGA, or IM2_MGGA.EXE for MCGA.
A bit of your time.
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. HOW TO UNPROTECT IMPOSSIBLE MISSION II:
First load the appropiat file into Norton.
Search for the string A2 CA 99 A2 28 9C.
Change these 6 bytes and the next 6 bytes (total of 12) to 90's.
Write the changes.
Then search for the bytes CD 21 B9 01 14.
Change the CD 21 to 90 90.
Write the changes.
Now search for F6 C4 10.
Change the byte immediatly following the 10 (75) to EB.
Write the changes.
Next search for the bytes BB 09 9A 8B CD.
Change the 2 bytes before this string (72 xx (xx is different for
some of the above files)) to 90 90.
Write the changes.
Now search for B9 10 00 F3 A7.
Change the 2 bytes following this string (75 xx) to 90 90.
Write the changes.
Now search for B9 04 00 F3 A7.
Change the 2 bytes following this string (75 xx) to 90 90.
Write the changes.
Now search for B8 09 02 CD 13.
Change the CD 13 to 90 90, and the byte following it (73) to EB.
Write the changes.
 
Now the check for the copy protection (a bad sector on disk A) is disabled. If
you don't intend to use the game on your hard disk you can now play the game
from and DISKCOPYed disk. If you want to play this game from a single directory
on any fixed disk follow the procedure below.
 
2. FIXING THE PROGRAM TO PLAY FROM 1 DIRECTORY: Once again load the appropiate
EXE file into Norton.  Search for the string CHARSf.  Basicly you will type
the file name after the CHARSf over CHARSf.  For example if the full string is
CHARSfTHISFILE.A  to THISFILE.A(00) (Note. the end of the file name is denoted
by a 00) hex). Be sure to look to see if the . after the file is indeed a . or
a 00 hex because some files have extentions and some don't and make sure that
you end the name you just typed over ends with a 00.
Write the changes.
Repete the prodcedure until you reach the end of the file.
Next do the same thing exept look for the string ROOMSf.
 
Now when you copy the game just copy all of the files from all directories from
your original disks to the directory on the hard drive you intend to use. You
can now enjoy the game without flipping thru floppy disks.

1. Norton Utilities (or similar program)
2. A copy of the file MM.EXE from your original disk.
3. A bit of your time
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. HOW TO UNPROTECT MIGHT AND MAGIC:
First load the file MM.EXE into Norton.
Then search for the string CD 13 72 EE.
Change these bytes to 90 90 90 90.
Write the changes.
Next search for the string CD 13 72 05.
Change these bytes to 90 90 90 90.
Write the changes.
Next search for the string CD 13 72 05.
Change the CD 13 to 90 90 and the 72 05 to EB 05.
A few bytes after this is a 75 F6, change these bytes to 90 90.
you will have to do this 4 more times here are the jumps to look
for: 75 20, 75 18, 75 10, 75 08. These will all be 7 bytes apart,
change them all to 90's.
Once again their will be another jump 7 bytes after the last one
you changed (74 03), change it to EB 03.
Write the changes.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The program will now skip the check for copy protection all
together.
 
If you have any problems with any of the patches above check the
date of the file MM.EXE on your original disk 1 for the date
11/18/87. If your file has a different date then they probably
changed the copy protection method and your out of luck with this
patch.

----------------------------------------------------------------
                             NEEDED:
Norton Utilities (or similar program)
A copy of the file start.exe from your pool of radiance disk
A bit of your time
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. HOW TO UNPROTECT POOL OF RADIANCE:
First load START.EXE into Norton
Then search for one of the key words from the code disk
Change the 6 letters of each word to whatever you want (make then
all the same for convince)
Save the changes
 
 
11/08/89
I just completed a new fix which will completely skip over the part where the
program asks you for the word from the code disk.  For Norton Utilities users
search for the string 9A 25 00 1D 00, change all of these bytes to 90's. For
all of you Debug fans out there rename the file START.EXE to say 123.AAA (or
whatever), then type S cs:100 900 9A 25 00 1D 00. It should show a match at
xxxx:05D7. Change the bytes by typing the following: E 05D7 EenterL, 90 EspaceL
90 EspaceL 90 EspaceL 90 EspaceL 90 EenterL.  Then write the file with the W
command and quit Debug. Now rename the file you just fixed to START.EXE and
your done.
 
01/03/90
I have just been made aware of another version of start.exe dated 12/12/88. To
get around the copy protection for this version with Norton search for the same
string listed above, with this version change the first four bytes to 90's and
leave the 00 alone.
 
Thanx Karl.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
2. SUPERCHARGING YOUR CHARACTERS:
Copy the file CHARFIX.EXE (included in this fix) into the directory where your
saved games reside. Change to that directory. Run the program, it is self
explanatory.
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
If you have any problems with any of the patches above check the
date of the file START.EXE on your original disk A for the date
10-26-88. If your file has a different date then they probably
changed the copy protection method and your out of luck with this
patch.

                             MINDSCAPE'S GAUNTLET
------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
                             NEEDED:
1. Norton Utilities (or similar program)
2. A copy of the file's gintro.exe and gprog.exe from your
original disk.
3. A bit of your time
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. HOW TO UNPROTECT GAUNTLET:
First load one of the above files into Norton.
Then search for the string F3 A7.
Change the byte immediately following (74) to EB.
Continue the search and once again change the 74 to EB.
Save the changes
Repeat the steps above for the other .EXE file.
 
For you Debug fans rename each of the two files to 1.aaa and 2.aaa
respectivaly.  Search (the S command) for F3 A7, you should get at least 3
matches.  You will need to unassemble each of the matches, the first copy
protection match should read REPZ CMPSW, JZ 2D96, ect..., and the second REPZ
CMPSW, JZ 2DB1, ect... With the E command using the FULL address of the JZ
commands change the 74's to EB's.  Write the files with the W command and
repeat the process for the other file.  When finishes erase Gintro.exe and
Gprog.exe and rename 1.aaa gintro.exe and 2.aaa gprog.exe.
 
In this version of the program will still look for the copy protection (which
is a sector at the end of the hard disk that the install program writes then
marks bad to prevent overwriting to that sector) but will continue the program
as if the comparison (F3 A7) was successful.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
If you have any problems with any of the patches above check the date of the
file GINTRO.EXE on your original disk A for the date 03/25/88. If your file has
a different date then they probably changed the copy protection method and your
out of luck with this patch.
 
----------------------------------------------------
                 How to fix copy protection from
                      Mindscape's Paperboy.
-----------------------------------------------------
 
1. Norton Utilities (or similar program)
2. A copy of the file's papercga.exe, papercgt.exe, and
papercg2.exe from your original disk.
3. A bit of your time
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
1. HOW TO UNPROTECT PAPERBOY:
First load one of the above files (whichever applies to your graphics, papercga
for cga graphics, papercgt for tandy graphics , or papercg2 for ega graphics)
into Norton.  Then search for the string 3D 33 00 75 FE.  Change the 74 FE to
90 90.  Save the changes
 
The program will still look for the copy protection files DEMAA.COM and
DEMAB.COM but will skip the instruction that locks up the system (74 FE (jump
back two bytes if comparison is not zero)).
 
If you have any problems with any of the patches above check the date of the
file PAPERxxx.EXE on your original disk A for the date 06/17/88. If your file
has a different date then they probably changed the copy protection method and
your out of luck with this patch.

The university policy against  computer software piracy has been widely
publicized,  including in a recent issue of Computing News (December, 1989).
There is no question that the university must protect  itself against actions
of the NIU  community for which it could be held legally accountable.
However,  based on our current research of the "computer underground" and the
activities of "phreaks, hackers,  and pirates," we find no evidence to
support the many value judgments  offered in the rationale circulated by the
university.
 
Our intent here is neither to justify software piracy nor to challenge
University policy.  However, because the area of copyright and  "computer
abuse" law is so new, and because these laws tend to rely on media and other
depictions of "computer underground" activity as criminally sanctionable, it
is important to counter conceptions  of underground activity that seem
unsubstantiated by evidence.
 
The university's normative justification of the University policy can be
summarized in three broad principles:
 
 1.  Software piracy shows disrespect for the intellectual work and property
     of others and subverts the mission of higher education.
 
 2.  Software piracy deprives authors of a "fair return" for their work.
 
 3.  Software piracy is unethical.
 
The data from  our research do not support  these judgments for several
reasons.
 
First,  software pirates make a  clear distinction between "pirates," persons
who collect and  share software as hobbyists akin to stamp collectors,
and "bootleggers." Bootleggers are persons who distribute software for
material gain.  Pirates may copy and install programs, but generally their
goal is to collect, and they derive satisfaction  from running programs for
which they have no need and that they will rarely, if ever, use.
 
Second, software pirates, despite the claims of the SPA (Software Publishsers
Association) report spending considerably more money purchasing software than
the average user. Many of these purchases are for trading,  and there is  a
strong ethos in the pirate world that if one uses a program, one purchases
it.  Reasons for purchasing include documents,  information  and discounts on
updates, and online technical support.  It is quite common for pirates to
purchase programs identical  to those they have already obtained.
 
Third,  the "no  return" policy of most  software merchandisers makes it
difficult for potential buyers  to assess the ability of a program to meet
their needs or work adequately on their system.  Piracy creates an informed
public  by assuring that programs are available for pretesting, by providing
a pool of reasonably literate users to  publicly discuss whether Word
Perfect is better    than XYwrite or WordStar,  and to even offer
technical assistance to those who have purchased a program.  In this sense,
the "unauthorized" copying of software can be  seen as contributing to the
university mission of expanding knowledge,  of preventing exploitation of
consumers through education, and above all, for expanding computer literacy
by contributing to  the free flow of information.
 
Fourth, pirates spend a considerable sum on their hobby.  One of the most
active topics of discussion among pirates is that of the need to continually
upgrade,  the continual purchase of diskettes on which to store programs,
and with the popularity of 9600 baud modems to invest between $600-900  for
telecommunications hardware.   Because most pirates  exchange software across
telephone lines,  piracy has benefitted telephone companies because of the
growth of Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs).  Our data indicate that an average
monthly phone bill of $200 or more is common,  and active pirates easily
double that cost.
 
Fifth, there is simply no evidence to corroborate that piracy deprives
authors of revenue.  Our data suggest that pirates annually purchase no less
than three times  the 1.5 programs the SPA estimates for the "average" user.
Further,  few students or faculty could afford the price of Dbase 4 and
other large programs,  and few people could afford to spend several thousand
dollars a year on computer games. Programs would simply remain unpurchased.
However, piracy creates an interest, expands consumer literacy,  and
contributes to a "user culture" that  benefits the industry as a whole.  We
suggest that without such a culture,  there would be less interest in software
and, consequently, less revenue for authors.
 
Sixth,  the claim that piracy is unethical is usually a glib one made without
a strong rationale. Although we make no metaphysical claims here,  we do
suggest that  piracy and current attempts to criminalize it are far to serious
to be so glibly stigmatized, and the issues require far more research and
debate.
 
The rapid  growth of computer and  telecommunications technology brings with
it new questions of the nature of "private property," free and open access to
information and resources,  and definitions of "authorship." Few among us
condone any form of predatory behavior.  However,  we find equally disturbing
the tendancy to perpetuate claims and definitions that should be brought into
a public forum for debate rather than  simply asserted from the position of
authority that leads to criminalization.

     Let's start with a simple introduction to patching a  program
     using the DOS DEBUG program.  The following article will  in-
     troduce you to the basic ideas and concepts of looking for  a
     certain area of a program and making a patch to it.
     -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
     By:            Charles Petzold / Specular Vision
     Title:         Case Study: A Colorful CLS
 
       This article originally appeared in the Oct.  14,1986 Issue
     of PC Magazine (Vol 15. Num 17.). Written by Charles Petzold.
 
       The hardest part of patching existing programs is determin-
     ing  where the patch should go.  You really have to  make  an
     intelligent guess about the functioning of the program.
 
       As an example,  let's attempt to modify COMMAND.COM so that
     is colors the screen on a CLS command.   As with any type  of
     patch try it out on a copy and NOT the original.
 
       First, think about what we should look for.  CLS is differ-
     ent from all the other DOS internal Commands,  It is the only
     internal command that does something to the screen other than
     just write to it with simple teletype output.  CLS blanks the
     screen and homes the cursor.   Since it can't do this through
     DOS Calls (unless ANSI.SYS is loaded), it is probably calling
     the BIOS Directly.   The BIOS Interrupt 10h call controls the
     video,  and so the CLS command probably uses several INT  10h
     instructions.  The machine code for INT 10h is CD 10.
 
       (While  this  same method will work under  any  version  of
     PC-DOS,  Version 2.0 and later, the addresses I'll  be  using
     are from PC-DOS 3.1. Other versions of PC-DOS(or MS-DOS) will
     have  different addresses;  you should be absolutely  certain
     that you're using the correct addresses.)
 
       Load COMMAND.COM into DEBUG:
 
                    DEBUG COMMAND.COM
 
     and do an R (Registers) command.  The size of COMMAND.COM  is
     in  register CX.   For DOS 3.1's COMMAND.COM,  this value  is
     5AAA.
 
       Now do Search command to look for the CD 10 bytes:
 
                    S 100 L 5AAA CD 10
 
     You'll get a list of six addresses, all clustered close to-
 
                                   4
     gether.  The first one is 261D. You can now pick an address a
     little before that (to see what the first call is doing)  and
     start disassembling:
 
                    U 261B
 
      The  first INT 10 has AH set to 0F which is a Current  Video
     State  call.   The code checks if the returned  value  of  AL
     me  to get started.   Next we'll look at two other  articles,
     both written by Buckaroo Banzi.   These two articles  CRACK-1
     and  CRACK-2 give you an introduction to the  different  copy
     protection schemes used on IBM PC's, and how to find and  by-
     pass them.

     Title:         Cracking On the IBM PC Part I
 
 
     Introduction
     ------------
       For  years,  I have seen cracking tutorials for  the  APPLE
     computers,  but never have I seen one for the PC.  I have de-
     cided to try to write this series to help that pirate move up
     a level to a crackest.
 
       In this part, I will cover what happens with INT 13 and how
     most copy protection schemes will use it.  I strongly suggest
     a  knowledge of Assembler (M/L) and how to use  DEBUG.  These
     will be an important figure in cracking anything.
 
 
     INT-13 - An overview
     --------------------
 
       Many  copy  protection  schemes  use  the  disk   interrupt
     (INT-13).  INT-13 is often use to either try to read in a il-
     legally   formatted   track/sector  or  to   write/format   a
     track/sector that has been damaged in some way.
 
       INT-13 is called like any normal interrupt with the  assem-
     bler  command INT 13 (CD 13).  [AH] is used to  select  which
     command to be used, with most of the other registers used for
     data.
 
     INT-13 Cracking College
     -----------------------
       Although,  INT-13 is used in almost all protection schemes,
     the easiest to crack is the DOS file.  Now the protected pro-
     gram  might use INT-13 to load some other data from a  normal
     track/sector on a disk, so it is important to determine which
     tracks/sectors  are  important to the protection  scheme.   I
     have  found  the best way to do this is to  use  LOCKSMITH/pc
     (what, you don't have LS. Contact your local pirate for it.)
 
       Use LS to analyze the diskette. Write down any track/sector
     that seems abnormal.  These track are must likely are part of
     the protection routine.   Now, we must enter debug. Load in
 
                                   7
     the  file  execute a search for CD 13.   Record  any  address
     show.
 
       If no address are picked up,  this mean 1 or 2 things,  the
     program is not copy protected (right...) or that the check is
     in an other part of the program not yet loaded.   The  latter
     being  a real hassle to find,  so I'll cover it in  part  II.
     There is another choice.   The CD 13 might be hidden in  self
     changing  code.   Here is what a sector of hidden code  might
     look like
 
     -U CS:0000
     1B00:0000 31DB     XOR    BX,BX
     1B00:0002 8EDB     MOV    DS,BX
     1B00:0004 BB0D00   MOV    BX,000D
     1B00:0007 8A07     MOV    AL,[BX]
     1B00:0009 3412     XOR    AL,12
     1B00:000B 8807     MOV    [BX],AL
     1B00:000D DF13            FIST   WORD...
 
       In  this  section of code,  [AL] is set to DF  at  location
     1B00:0007.   When you XOR DF and 12,  you would get a CD(hex)
     for  the  INT opcode which is placed right next to a  13  ie,
     giving you CD13 or INT-13.   This type of code can't and will
     not be found using debug's [S]earch command.
 
 
 
     Finding Hidden INT-13s
     ----------------------
 
       The  way I find best to find hidden INT-13s,  is to  use  a
     program called PC-WATCH (TRAP13 works well also).   This pro-
     gram  traps  the interrupts and will print  where  they  were
     called  from.   Once running this,  you can just  disassemble
     around  the address until you find code that look like it  is
     setting up the disk interrupt.
 
       An  other way to decode the INT-13 is to use  debug's  [G]o
     command.   Just  set  a breakpoint at  the  address  give  by
     PC-WATCH  (both  programs give the return address).   Ie,  -G
     CS:000F (see code above).   When debug stops,  you will  have
     encoded  not only the INT-13 but anything else leading up  to
     it.
 
 
     What to do once you find INT-13
     -------------------------------
 
       Once you find the INT-13,  the hard part for the most  part
     is over.   All that is left to do is to fool the computer  in
     to thinking the protection has been found.   To find out what
     the computer is looking for, examine the code right after the
     INT-13.  Look for any branches having to do with the
 
                                   8
ny CMP to the AH register.  If a JNE or JC
      (etc) occurs, then [U]nassembe the address listed with the
     jump.  If it is a CMP then just read on.
 
       Here you must decide if the program was looking for a  pro-
     tected  track or just a normal track.   If it has a CMP  AH,0
     and it has read in a protected track,  it can be assumed that
     it  was looking to see if the program had  successfully  com-
     plete  the  READ/FORMAT of that track and that the  disk  had
     been  copied thus JMPing back to DOS (usually).   If this  is
     the case,  Just NOP the bytes for the CMP and the correspond-
     ing JMP.
 
       If  the program just checked for the carry flag to be  set,
     and it isn't,  then the program usually assumes that the disk
     has been copied. Examine the following code
 
           INT 13      <-- Read in the Sector
           JC 1B00     <-- Protection found
           INT 19      <-- Reboot
     1B00  (rest of program)
 
       The program carries out the INT and find an error (the  il-
     legally formatted sector) so the carry flag is set.  The com-
     puter,  at the next instruction,  see that the carry flag  is
     set  and know that the protection has not been  breached.  In
     this case, to fool the computer, just change the "JC 1B00" to
     a "JMP 1B00" thus defeating the protection scheme.
 
     NOTE: the PROTECTION ROUTINE might be found in more than just
           1 part of the program

     Cracking Tutorial II.
 
     By:            Buckaroo Banzai
     Title:         Cracking On the IBM PC Part II
 
 
     Introduction
     ------------
 
       OK guys,  you now passed out of Copy Class 101 (dos  files)
     and have this great new game with overlays.   How do I  crack
     this one.  You scanned the entire .EXE file for the CD 13 and
     it's nowhere.  Where can it be you ask yourself.
 
       In  part II,  I'll cover cracking Overlays and the  use  of
     locksmith in cracking.   If you haven't read part I,  then  I
     suggest you do so.  The 2 files go together.
 
 
     Looking for Overlays
     --------------------
it can mean
     4 things.
 
          1:  The .EXE (though it is mostly .COM) file is  just  a
              loader for the main file.
 
          2:  The .EXE file loads in an overlay.
 
          3:  The CD 13 is encrypted &/or hidden in the .EXE file.
 
          4:  Your looking at the WRONG file.
 
 
       I  won't  discuss case 1 (or at least no here)  because  so
     many UNP files are devoted to PROLOCK and SOFTGUARD,  if  you
     can't figure it out with them, your stupid.
 
       If you have case 3, use the technique in part I and restart
     from the beginning. And if you have case 4, shoot your self.
 
       You  know  the program uses overlays but don't see  and  on
     disk?   Try looking at the disk with good old Norton's.   Any
     hidden files are probably the overlays.   These are the  ones
     we  are after.   If you still can't find them,  use  PC-WATCH
     (this program is a must!!! For all crackists.   Traps ALL in-
     terrupts).
 
                                  11
 
     Using PC-Watch to Find Overlays

     Search  the  right Col.  until you find DOS21 -  OpnFile  and
     select it.
 
          Now run the program to be cracked.
          Play the game until the protection is checked.
          Examine  you PCWatch output to see what file was  loaded
           right before it.
          This probably is the one holding the check.
          If not, go through all the files.
 
 
     You Have Found the Overlays
     ---------------------------
       Great,  now just crack the overlay as if it was a DOS file.
     You don't need to worry about .EXE file,  debug can write  an
     overlay  file.   Part I explains the basics of  cracking.   I
     suggest that you keep a backup copy of the overlay so if  you
     mess up,  and you will, you can recover quickly. Ah,  and you
      I find it useful,  before I even start cracking,  to analyze
  the  protected  disk to find and id  it's  protection.   This
     helps in 2 ways.   First,  it helps you to know what to do in
     order to fake out the protection.   Second,  it helps you  to
     find what the program is looking for.
 
      I  suggest that you get locksmith if you don't already  have
     it.   Check your local pirate board for the program.   I also
     suggest  getting PC-Watch and Norton Utilities 3.1.(Now  4.1)
     All of these program have many uses in the cracking world.
 
     END.

     -------------------------------------------------------------
     OK,  now let's put some of this information into practice  by
     examining a few cracks of some common programs.   First we'll
     look at a Crack for Mean-18 Golf by Accolade.   Accolade  has
     been one of those companies that has a fervent belief in Copy
     Protection.
     -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
     Title:         MEAN-18 UnProtect For CGA/EGA Version
 
     This crack works by eliminating the code that tests for known
     bad  sectors  on the original diskette to see if  it  is  the
     genuine article or an illegal copy.   The code begins with an
     INT 13 (CD 13 HEX),  a DOS BIOS disk service routine followed
     a few bytes later by another INT 13 instruction.  The program
     then checks the returned value for the bit configuration that
     signifies the bad sectors and, if all is as expected, contin-
     ues on with program execution.
 
     The code that needs to be patched is in the GOLF.EXE file and
     in the ARCH.EXE file.  It is identical in both files and lies
     near the end of each file.
 
     In the following steps,  you'll locate the start of the  test
     code and patch it by replacing it with NOP instructions  (HEX
     90).   The  method described uses the DOS DEBUG  utility  but
     Norton's Utility (NU) works too.
 
     Copy  all  of the files from the MEAN-18 disk  onto  a  fresh
     floppy  using  the DOS COPY command and place  your  original
     diskette out of harm's way.
 
     Assuming DEBUG is in the A:  drive and the floppy  containing
     the files to be unlocked is in the B: drive , proceed as fol-
     lows:
 
     First  REName  the  GOLF.EXE  file  so  it  has  a  different
     EXTension other than .EXE.
 
                    REN GOLF.EXE GOLF.DEB
 
 
     Next  load the file GOLF.DEB into DEBUG and displays the  "-"
     DEBUG prompt.
 
                    A:> DEBUG B:GOLF.EXE
 
                                  13
     Search for the beginning of the code to be patched by typing:
 
 
                    - S CS:100 FFFF CD 13
 
     Searches  the file for the two byte INT 13  instruction.   If
     all goes well, two addresses should appear on the screen.
 
                    XXXX:019C
                    XXXX:01A8
 
     XXXX indicates that the numbers preceeding the ":"  vary from
     system  to system but the numbers following the ":"  are  the
     same on all systems.
 
     The  next  step is to use the "U"  command  as  indicated  to
     un-assemble  a few bytes in order to verify your position  in
     the file)
 
                    - U CS:019C
 
     (Un-assembles  32 bytes of code.   Verify the  following  se-
     quence of instructions:
 
                    INT       13
                    JB        01E9
                    MOV       AL,[BX+01FF]
                    PUSH      AX
                    MOV       AX,0201
                    INT       13
                    POP       AX
                    JB        01E9
                    CMP       AL,F7
                    JNZ       01B5
 
     These are the instructions you'll be patching out in the fol-
     lowing step)
 
                    - A CS:019C
 
     This command assembles the new instructions you enter at  the
     keyboard into the addresses shown.  Beginning at CS:019C, and
     for the next 21 bytes, ending with and including CS:01B0, en-
     ter  the no op command "NOP" (90h) followed by a <return>  or
     <enter>.   Just hit <enter> at address XXXX:01B1 to  end  the
     assemble command.)
 
                    XXXX:019C  NOP <enter>
                    XXXX:019D  NOP <enter>
                               .
                               .
                               .
                    XXXX:01AE  NOP <enter>
                    XXXX:01AF  NOP <enter>
 
                                  14
                    XXXX:01B0  NOP <enter>
                    XXXX:01B1 <enter>
 
     This just wipes out the section of code containing the INT 13
     check.
 
     Now  do  a HEX dump and verify that bytes 019C  through  01B0
     have been set to 90 HEX.
                    - D CS:019C
 
     If they have, write the patched file to the disk as follows)
 
                    - W
 
     This    writes    the    patched    file    back    to    the
 
but
     now,  it  can be run from any drive,  including  the     hard
     drive)
 
     Now just [Q]uit or exit back to DOS.  This command can be ex-
 ecuted at any "-" DEBUG prompt if you get lost.  No modifica-
     tion will be made to the file on the disk until you issue the
     "W" command.
 
                    - Q
 
     The process is the same for the ARCH.EXE file but because  it
     is a different length, the segment address, (XXXX part of the
     13  instruction  at address XXXX:019C and the second  one  at
     XXXX:01A8 as before.
 
     You  will again be patching 21 bytes and you will start  with
     019C and end with 01B0 as before.   After doing the HEX  dump
     starting  at address 019C,  you again write the file back  to
 
                    RCS<cr>
 
 
                                  16
     Debug will prompt you for the new value of CS with:
 
                    CS:27FC:
 
       You  respond  by typing the value of DS you  saw  when  you
     dumped the registers the first time.   For example,  I  typed
     "12CE<cr>".   The  value you type will be  different.   Debug
     will  again respond with the "-"  prompt which means  we  are
     ready to do our search.   Type in the following after the "-"
     prompt:
 
                    S CS:0 FFFF CD 13<cr>
 
       The computer should respond with three lines of information
     which are the addresses of the three Interrupt 13 calls built
     into the program.   The first four digits are the segment ad-
     dress  and will equal to the value of CS you have  just  set.
     The second four digits following the colon are the offset ad-
     dresses which are of primary interest to us.   On my  machine
     they came back as follows:
 
                    12CE:4307
                    12CE:431F
                    12CE:4335
 
       The segment addresses will be identical and the three  off-
     set  addresses should all be relatively close together.   Now
     look at the first offset address.  (As you can see,  mine was
     "4307".) Write it down.  Now we do a bit of Unassembly.
 
       Type "U4307<cr>"  which is the letter "U", followed immedi-
     ately  (with no blank spaces) by whatever your  first  offset
     address turned out to be, followed by a carriage return.   If
     you are not familiar with unassembled machine code,  it  will
     look like lines of gibberish as follows:
 
                    12CE:4307 CD13        INT      13
                    12CE:4309 4F          DEC      DI
                    12CE:430A 744C        JZ       4358
                              .
                              .
                    12CE:431F CD13        INT      13
                    12CE:4321 4F          DEC      DI
                              .
                              .
                    12CE:4324 BF0400      MOV      DI,0004
                    12CE:4326 B80102      MOV      AX,0201
 
       In  my computer,  Unassemble will automatically  output  16
     lines of code to the screen.  Yours may differ.  Note, in the
     (INT  13) correspond to the first two addresses we  found  in
     our search.  Now we continue the unassemble, and here comes
 
                                  17
     another  tricky part.   Just type in "U<cr>"  after  the  "-"
     prompt.
 
       You'll get sixteen more lines of code with the third Inter-
     rupt 13 on a line which begins with the address (CS):4335  if
     you  have  the same version of Submarine as I do.   It's  not
     terribly  important  to  this  exercise,   but  it  will   at
     least show you that things are proceeding okay.   Now type in
     "U<cr>"  again  after the prompt.  You are  now  looking  for
     three key lines of code.   On my program they appear as  fol-
     lows:
 
                    12CE:4335 07          POP      ES
                    12CE:4356 5D          POP      BP
                    12CE:4357 CB          RETF
 
     The true key is the instruction "POP ES".   This  instruction
     begins  the normal return sequence after the program has  ex-
     ecuted its Interrupt 13 instructions and accompanying checks.
     If  Debug on your machine prints fewer than 16 lines of  code
     at a shot, you may have to type in "U" more than twice at the
     "-" to find these instructions.  (If you haven't found any of
     this stuff, either get help on the use of Debug or go back to
                    A4307<cr>
 
       This first bit tells Debug that new Assembler code will  be
     inserted at the address of the first Interrupt 13.   If  your
     first  Interrupt 13 is at an address other that  "4307",  use
     the correct address,  not mine.  The computer will prompt you
 
     with the address:
 
                    12CE:4307
 
     After which you will immediately type:
 
                    JMP 4354<cr>
 
     This instruction jumps the program immediately to the  normal
     return code instructions.  Again, at the risk of being redun-
     dant, if your "POP ES" instruction is at a different address,
     use that address, not "4354"!
 
     The computer will prompt you with the address of the next in-
 
                                  18
     struction  if  all went well.   MAKE SURE you  just  hit  the
     carriage  return at this point.  Debug will then  return  the
     familiar "-" prompt.
 
     Now  it's  time  to examine your  handiwork.   Let's  do  the
     unassemble again starting at the address of what had been the
     first Interrupt 13 instruction, but which is now the Jump in-
     struction.  Type in "U4307<cr>" or "U" followed by the appro-
     priate address and a carriage return.   The first line begin-
     ning with the address should appear as follows:
 
                    12CE:4307 EB4B        JMP      4354
 
     The key here is the four bytes immediately following the  ad-
     dress.   In my example they are "EB4B".   Yours may  not  be.
     But,  they are VERY IMPORTANT because they represent the  ac-
     tual machine code which is the Jump instruction.  WRITE THESE
     FOUR BYTES DOWN AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT.
 
       Now  if  you want to have some fun before we go  on,  reset
     register  CS to its original value by first typing  "RCS<cr>"
     and execute your program.   If you have followed my  instruc-
     tions, it should run fine.  Get help if it doesn't.  Now, you
     should be all set.  You can load onto your hard disk,  if you
     haven't already.  You can run it from a RAM disk using a  BAT
     file if you really want it to hum.   Or,  if you have the fa-
     cilities,  you can copy it from 5-1/4" floppy to 3-1/2"  dis-
     kette and run it on machines which accept that medium if  you
     upgrade to a new computer.
 
     END.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                  20
     Now let's take a look at a newer crack on the program,  Space
     Station Oblivion by Eypx.  At a first [S]earch with Debug and
     Norton's  Utility no CD 13's could be found,  and yet it  was
     using them... So a different approach had to be taken...
     -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
     By:            PTL
     Title:         Space Station Oblivion Crack
 
 
     First of all,  you must determine which file the INT 13's are
     in,  in this case it had to be the file OBLIVION.EXE since it
     was the main program and probably contained the INT 13's.  So
     then rename it to a different EXTension and load it into  De-
     bug.
 
     Then do a [S]earch for INT 13's.
 
                    -S 100 FFFF CD 13
 
     Which will promptly turned up nothing.  Hmmm...
 
     Next you might decide that, maybe, the code was modifying it-
     self.   So quit from Debug and load up PC-Watch,  include all
     the  INT  13  Calls.   For those of  you  not  familiar  with
     PC-Watch,  it is a memory resident program that can be set to
     look  for  any type of BIOS call.   When that  call  is  made
     PC-Watch prints to the screen the contents of all the  regis-
     ters  and the current memory location that the call was  made
     from.
 
     After PC-Watch is initialized, then run the OBLIVION.EXE file
     from the hard disk,  leaving the floppy drive door open,  and
     sure  enough,  when the red light comes on in   the  diskette
     drive,  PC-Watch  will report the address's of  some  INT  13
     calls.  Which you should then write down.
 
     From  there,  quit the game, reboot,  (To dump PC-Watch  from
     memory) and load the OBLIVION.EXE into Debug and issue a [G]o
     command with a breakpoint.  What address should you use for a
     breakpoint?   You guessed it, the same address PC-Watch gives
     you.
     Well,  it locked up did'nt it?  Which is quite common in this
     line of work so don't let that discourage you.   So next  re-
     loaded  it into debug and this time [U]nassemble the  address
     that you got from PC-Watch.   But instead of finding the  INT
     13's you'll find harmless INT 21's.
 
     Hmm...  could  it be that the program was converting  the  CD
     21's to CD 13's during the run?   Well,  to test the idea as-
     semble an INT 20 (Program Terminate) right after the first
 
                                  21
     INT 21. Then I run the program, and yes immediately after the
     red light comes on the drive, the program will terminate nor-
     mally.
 
     Then [U]nassemble that same area of memory,  and low and  be-
     hold,  some  of the INT 21's have magically turned  into  INT
     13's.  How clever...
 
     So,  then it is just a matter of locating the address of  the
     routine that it jumped (JMP) to if the correct disk was found
     in  drive A:.   Once you have that address,  just go  to  the
     start of all this nonsense and [A]ssemble a JMP XXXX command.
     Where  XXXX was the address to jump to if the  original  disk
     was in drive A:.
 
     Then  just [W]rite the file back out to the disk  and  [Q]uit
     debug,   and  then  REName  the  file  back  to  OBLIVION.EXE
     afterwhich it should work fine.
 
 
     END.
 
                                  22
 
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     A  new fad has recently started up with software vendors,  it
     involves  the use of "Passwords" which are either  stored  in
     the  documentation or are actually the documentation  itself.
     Then  when you reach a certain part of the  program  (Usually
     the beginning) the program will ask for the password and  you
     have  to look it up in the Docs before being allowed to  con-
     tinue.   If the wrong password is entered,  it  will  usually
     drop you to DOS or take you to a Demo version of the program.
 
     This  new form of copy protection is very annoying,  but  can
     usually  be cracked without too much effort,   and the  files
     and the disk are usually in the standard DOS format.   So now
     we'll take a look at cracking the Doc check questions.
 
     First  of  all  we'll crack the startup  questions  in   F-15
     Strike Eagle by MicroProse.

     Title:         F-15 Unprotect
 
 
 
     Make a copy of the original disk using the DOS DISKCOPY  pro-
     gram.
 
                    >DISKCOPY A: B:
 
     Then  insert the copy disk in the A drive and invoke DOS  DE-
     BUG.
 
                    >DEBUG
 
     Now we'll [F]ill an area of memory with nothing (00).
 
                    -F CS:100 L FEFF 0
 
     Next we will [L]oad into address CS:0100 the data that is  on
     the A: disk (0) from sector 0 to sector 80.
 
                    -l cs:100 0 0 80
 
     Now  lets [S]earch the data we loaded for the area where  the
     copy protection routine is.
 
                    -s cs:100 l feff FA EB FD
 
     Then for each of the occurences listed, use the address DEBUG
     returned in the [E]nter command below.
 
                                  23
 
                    -e xxxx 90 90 90
 
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     Here's the part we are interested in,  it's where you  change
     all  the autorization codes to a space.   Notice how you  can
     use the [S]earch command to look for ASCII text.
     -------------------------------------------------------------
 
                    -s cs:100 l feff "CHIP"
 
     Then for each occurance of "CHIP"  use the address DEBUG  re-
     turned in the [F]ill command below.
 
                    -F XXXX L F 20
 
     Write out the modified data
 
                    -W CS:100 1 0 80
 
     Quit DEBUG
 
                    -Q
 
 
       You should now be able to DISKCOPY and boot from all copies
     also  just press the space bar when it ask for ANY  authority
     code and then press "ENTER". Now there is no need to remember
     (or look up) any codes that are so finely tucked away in  the
     manual!

     Here is a similar method that was used break the passwords in
     the  program BATTLEHAWKS 1945 by Lucasfilms.  However  Norton
     Utilities  is  used to search for the  passwords  and  change
     them.
     -------------------------------------------------------------

     Title:         BATTLEHAWKS-1945 Doc Check Crack
 
 
     In  keeping in line with their previous programs,  Lucasfilms
     has  released yet another program which uses Doc  Checks  for
     its means of copy protection, Battlehawks 1942.
 
     When you run this program,  it first goes through a series of
     graphic displays, then it goes through a series of questions,
     asking what type of mission you want to fly,  such as  Train-
     ing, Active Duty, or which side of the war you want to be on.
 
     Then right before the simulation begins,  it shows you a pic-
     ture of a Japanese Zero and ask you for a password which you
 
     are  then  supposed to get by looking up the picture  of  the
     Zero in the User Manual and typing the corresponding password
     in.   After which it enters the simulation,  in the event you
     enter  the wrong password,  it puts you into a training  mis-
     sion.
 
     Removing  the  Doc Check in a program like  this  is  usually
     pretty  easy.   The ideal way to do it is to remove  the  Doc
     Check routine itself,  but if you don't have all day to debug
     and  trace  around the code this might not be the  best  way.
     For  instance if you only have your lunch hour to work on  it
     (Like  I did),  then you need to use the standard  Q.D.C.R.S.
     (Quick Doc Check Removal System).
 
     How do you do a QDCRS?  Well first of all,  play around  with
     the program,  find out what it will and will NOT accept as  a
     password.   Most  programs will accept anything,  but  a  few
     (Like Battlehawks) will only accept Alpha characters.
 
     Once you've learned what it likes,  make an educated guess as
     to what program the Doc Check routine is in.   Then load that
     program into Norton's Utility (NU).
 
     At this point,  take a look at the passwords,  and write down
     the most unusual one that you can find (I'll explain  later).
     Now  type that password in as the search string,  and let  NU
     search through the file until it finds the password.   Now  a
     couple of things can happen.
 
          1. It only finds one occurrence
          2. It finds more than one occurrence
        3. It doesn't find any occurrence
 
     In  the event of case 2 then YOU have to determine where  the
     passwords  are stored,  you can do this by opening your  eyes
     and looking.
 
     In the event of case 3,  go to the kitchen and start a pot of
     coffee, then tell you wife to go to bed without you,  because
     you have a "Special Project" that you have to finish tonight.
     And by the way, Good Luck.  You'll need it.
 
     Hopefully case 1 will occur,  now you have to take a look  at
     the data and ask yourself 2 questions:
 
          1. Are all the passwords the same length?
          2. Is there a set number of spaces  between  each  pass-
             word?
          3. Does the next password always start a certain  number
             of characters from the first character of the  previ-
             ous password?
 
     If you can answer yes to any of the above questions,  you  in
     luck.  All you have to do is change the passwords to spaces
 
     (If the program allows that,  Battlehawks doesn't) or  change
     them to you favorite character. The letter X works good, it's
     easy to type and easy to remember.
 
     If you can't answer yes to any of the questions then you  ei-
     ther need to bypass the Doc Check routine itself or you  need
     to be adventurous and experiment. Battlehawks will not follow
     any  of the above patterns,  and your quickly running out  of
     time, so you'll have to try something, fast...
 
     So  just  wiped out all of the data area with  X's,  all  the
     passwords and associated "garbage" between them.   Then saved
     the changes and drop out of NU and into BH.  Then when it ask
     for the password,  just filed the area with X's.  Next  thing
     you  know,  you'll be escorting a bombing run on  a  Japanese
     carrier.
 
     So,  this one turned out to be fairly simple.   Where you may
     run into trouble is on Doc Checks that use a graphic  system,
     such as Gunship by MicroProse.  When it comes to this type of
     Doc Check, you almost have to bypass the routine itself.  And
     again, a good way to do this is with setting break points and
     using the trace option in Debug.
 
     END.

     -------------------------------------------------------------
     That  was the easy version Doc Check crack,  however there  a
     "Better"  way to crack Doc Checks,  is to bypass the  routine
     completely  so  the user can just press enter and  not  worry
     about spaces.   Let's take a lot at this method by looking at
     a crack for the program, Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer, by
     Electronic Arts.

     Now we'll take a look at cracking self booters.  A few compa-
     nies  have found this to be the best copy  protection  scheme
     for them, one of which is DataEast, makers of Ikari Warriors,
     Victory Road,  Lock-On, Karnov, etc...  This posses a special
     problem  to the Amateur Cracker, since they seldom use  stan-
     dard DOS formats.  So let's jump right in!
     -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
     This  is the area where a "Higher than Normal"  knowledge  of
     Assembly  Language and DOS Diskette structures,  so first  of
     all, the Basic's.
 
 
     The Disk's Physical Structure
 
     Data is recorded on a disk in a series of concentric circles,
     called Tracks.   Each track if further divided into segments,
     called  Sectors.   The  standard  double-density  drives  can
     record  40 tracks of data, while the new quad-density  drives
     can record 80 tracks.
 
     However, the location, size, and number of the sectors within
     a  track are under software control.   This is why  the  PC's
     diskettes are known as soft-sectored.  The characteristics of
     a  diskette's sectors (Their size, and the number per  track)
     are set when each track is formatted.  Disk Formatting can be
     done either by the operating system or by the ROM-BIOS format
     service.   A lot of self booters and almost all forms of copy
     protection  create unusual formats via the ROM-BIOS  diskette
     services.
 
     The  5 1/4-inch diskettes supported by the standard  PC  BIOS
     may  have  sectors that are 128,256,512,  or 1,024  bytes  in
     size.   DOS, from versions 1.00 through 4.01 has consistently
     used sectors of 512 bytes, and it is quite possible that this
     will continue.
 
     Here is a table displaying 6 of the most common disk formats:
     _____________________________________________________________
 
     Type      Sides        Sectors       Tracks       Size(bytes)
     _____________________________________________________________
 
      S-8        1             8            40            160K
      D-8        2             8            40            320K
      S-9        1             9            40            180K
      D-9        2             9            40            360K
     QD-9        2             9            80            720K
     QD-15       2            15            80          1,200K
     _____________________________________________________________
 
 
 
     S  - Single Density
     D  - Double Density
     QD - Quad Density
 
     Of all these basic formats,  only two are in widespread  use:
     S-8  and D-9.   The newer Quad Density formats are for the  3
     1/2" and 5 1/4" high density diskettes.
 
 
            * SIDES.PER.DISK
 
     And  here are the formulas for converting  sequential  sector
     numbers to three-dimensional coordinates:
 
          BIOS.SECTOR = 1 + DOS.SECTOR.NUMBER MOD SECTORS.PER.SIDE
            BIOS.SIDE = (DOS.SECTOR.NUMBER f SECTORS.PER.SIDE)
            MOD SIDE.PER.DISK
            BIOS.TRACK = DOS.SECTOR.NUMBER f (SECTORS.PER.SIDE
            * SIDES.PER.DISK)
 
          (Note:  For double-sided nine-sector diskettes, the PC's
          most  common disk format, the value of  SECTORS.PER.SIDE
          is  9 and the value of SIDES.PER.DISK is 2.   Also  note
          that  sides and tracks are numbered differently  in  the
          ROM-BIOS numbering system: The sides and tracks are num-
     Diskette Space Allocation
 
     The  formatting  process divides the sectors on a  disk  into
     four sections, for four different uses.  The sections, in the
     order they are stored, are the boot record,  the file alloca-
     tion  table (FAT),  the directory, and the data  space.   The
     size of each section varies between formats,  but the  struc-
     ture and the order of the sections don't vary.
          The Boot Record:
 
          This section is always a single sector located at sector
     1 of track 0, side 0.  The boot record contains,  among other
     things,  a short program to start the process of loading  the
     operating system on it.   All diskettes have the boot  record
     on them even if they don't have the operating system.  Asisde
     from  the start-up program,  the exact contents of  the  boot
     record vary from format to format.
 
          The File Allocation Table:
 
          The  FAT follows the boot record,  usually  starting  at
     sector 2 of track 0,  side 0.   The FAT contains the official
     record of the disk's format and maps out the location of  the
     sectors used by the disk files.   DOS uses the FAT to keep  a
     record of the data-space usage.  Each entry in the table con-
     tains  a specific code to indicate what space is being  used,
     what space is available,  and what space is unusable (Due  to
     defects on the disk).
 
          The File Directory:
 
          The file directory is the next item on the disk.   It is

     Here  is a simple routine to just make a backup copy  of  the
     Flight Simulator Version 1.0 by Microsoft.  I know the latest
     version  is  3.x but this version will serve the  purpose  of
     demonstrating  how to access the data and program files of  a
     selfbooter.

     This procedure will NOT convert the Flight Simulator disk  to
     files  that can be loaded on a hard drive.   But...  it  will
     read  off the data from the original and put it onto  another
     floppy.  And this should give you an idea of how to read data
     directly from a disk and write it back out to another disk.
 
     First of all take UNFORMATTED disk and place it in drive  B:.
     This will be the target disk.
 
     Now  place your DOS disk (which has Debug) into drive A:,  or
     just load Debug off you hard disk.

 Title: Good BBS
 
A good BBS is not only having all files online (as the phringe used to do) but
also! having a good user base that is helpfull and not worring about petty
problems.  There aren't many real good boards among the many boards available
here locally, but a board that comes to mind that you should try to emulate and
exceed is winplace's old board wasteland I, This is just my opinion and I hope
that this board becomes as good as you hope it to be!

 Title: What makes a BBS a "GOOD" BBS?!
 
Well I had this chat talk with a user and he referred to few BBSs as the "GOOD"
BBSs and I stopped him to ask him why are those the good BBSs and if there's
anything the matter with this one so the answer to that was that I should'nt
even "DARE" to compare my BBS with those "GOOD" ones!  The question is WHY?
What am I missing in this BBS that the others don't or what the A or B bbs is
missing (not mine in particular).  So that brings up another very INTERESTING
topic that I expect to hear some views on...WHAT MAKES A BBS TICK???
Is it the users?
Is it the file section?
Is it the Message section?
Is it the mass storage?
etc etc....
If you want my opinion, I think that the users make a BBS tick and thats the
bottom line, a BBS with no users or dorky users or users that are just there
and they just exist without offering anything is just NOT a BBS... This guy
also said that the BIG BBSs (the ones with mass storage, and lots of phone
lines and stuff!) are BAD! he says that "you rich guys! (without even knowing
me or my W2) think you can put 300 or 600 megs online and have a BBS" well I
personally think that a BBS with most of the files being ONLINE and not OFFLINE
has a TREMENDOUS advantage over the BBS that has every file in the world but
all of them are OFFLINE!... What good would it do me if I need a file right now
and I call my supporting BBS to take it down but due to the lack of space the
sysop has it OFFLINE and then I kinda have to beg for the file to be online and
call back till he or she decides to put it up for me (not necessarily the case
always!).  I was also reffered to as "a snobish guy"! (again without knowing
me)..Now please really tell me if (and this is your best chance to get back at
me!) I seemed snobish or not willing to help any and all of you outthere... I
wanna make this BBS work and try to make it (if not the BEST in the MIDWEST) at
least one of the best, I want it to have a unique look I want it to have
respect for its users and I want its users to have respect for it..
 
Please FEEL FREE to respond to this message and I do expect you to FREELY
express your opinions and let us know WHAT MAKES A BBS TICK?!

 Title: Good BBS's
 
Well, I feel what makes a good BBS is a friendly attitude between the users and
the sysop('s). I just logged off the Melting Point and felt verbaly abused.
That board bombards you with demands that you participate in every aspect of
his bbs. This is not an attack on him, as I'm sure he isnt attacking me
personally, but I dont like to have demands thrown at me in mass e-mail.  And
this post or die attitude many boards are getting is putting me off too. I dont
know, mabey the majority of us pirates are a bunch of assholes that need to be
screamed at, but I like to think not.

 Title: Melting Point
 
i think people should contribute to a board,there are those of you who log on a
bbs,look through the board,then log off!.....thats just wasting the time of the
sysop (trying to provide a quality bbs not a library book) and wasting the time
of other user that are probably autodialing like mad to get on and contribute.
i have a few users that do it and i get fed up with it. ....also the sysop go's
out and spends MULTI THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS makeing a bbs buying the equipment
and so forth.....i think the sysop has a right to know who's using his bbs and
what the user has to offer him in exhchange for the privelige of haveing time
on the system......so all you out there that read this and dont abide by "the
way it is" shouldnt bitch about it.....just dont call anymore.....its not good
to lose people on a board but if u look at it this way.......there are alot
more people out there to take your user number!  replies are always encouraged
in the constant effort of keeping users happy with the systems they
call........SO LETS SEE SOME POSTS!!!!!!
 
 
                     Ethics for BBS users - By Steve King
 
The following are a few points of general BBS etiquette.  If  you wish  to
maintain your welcome on whatever system you  happen  to call,  it would be to
your advantage to observe these few  rules.  (Sysops - feel free to download
this & display it on your BBS)
 
1.   Don't habitually hang up on a system.  Every Sysop is  aware that
accidental disconnections happen once in a while but we  do tend  to  get
annoyed with people who hang up every  single  time they call because they are
either too lazy to terminate  properly or  they labor under the mistaken
assumption that the 10  seconds they  save  online is going to significantly
alter  their  phone bill.   "Call Waiting" is not an acceptable excuse for
long.   If you  have it and intend to use the line to call BBS systems,  you
should  either  have it disconnected or find some  other  way  to circumvent
it.
 
2.  Don't do dumb things like leave yourself a message that  says "Just
testing to see if this thing works".  Where do  you  think all those other
messages came from if it didn't work? Also, don't leave  whiney messages that
say "Please leave me a message".   If ever there was a person to ignore, it's
the one who begs  someone to  leave him a message.  If you want to get
messages,  start  by reading the ones that are already online and getting
involved  in the conversations that exist.
 
3.   Don't use the local equivalent of a chat command unless  you really  have
some clear cut notion of what you want to  say  and why.  Almost any Sysop is
more than happy to answer questions  or offer  help concerning his system.
Unfortunately, because  about 85%  of the people who call want to chat and
about 99%  of  those people have absolutely nothing to say besides "How old are
you?" or  something  equally  irrelevent,  fewer  Sysops  even   bother
answering their pagers every day.
 
4.  When you are offered a place to leave comments when exiting a system,
don't try to use this area to ask the  Sysop  questions.  It is very rude to
the other callers to expect the Sysop to carry on  a  half  visible
conversation with someone.  If  you  have  a question or statement to make and
expect the Sysop to respond  to it,  it should always be made in the section
where all the  other messages  are  kept.  This allows the Sysop to help  many
people with  the  same problem with the least amount of  effort  on  his part.
 
5.   Before  you log on with your favorite psuedonym,  make  sure that  handles
are allowed.  Most Sysops don't want  people  using handles  on the system.
There is not enough room for them,  they get  silly  games of one-upmanship
started, it is much  nicer  to deal  with a person on a personal basis, and
last but not  least, everyone  should be willing to take full responsibility
for  his actions or comments instead of slinging mud from behind a  phoney
name.
 
6.   Take the time to log on properly.  There is no such place as RIV, HB, ANA
or any of a thousand other abbreviations  people use instead of their proper
city.  You may think that everyone  knows what  RIV is supposed to mean, but
every BBS has  people  calling from  all around the country and I assure you
that  someone  from Podunk, Iowa has no idea what you're  talking about.
 
7.  Don't go out of your way to make rude observations like "Gee, this system
is slow".  Every BBS is a tradeoff of features.   You can  generally  assume
that if someone is  running  a  particular brand  of  software,  that he is
either happy with  it  or  he'll decide  to find another system he likes
better.  It  does  nobody any good when you make comments about something that
you perceive to  be a flaw when it is running the way the Sysop wants  it  to.
Constructive criticism is somewhat more welcome.  If you have  an alternative
method that seems to make good sense then run it  up the flagpole.
 
8.   When leaving messages, stop and ask yourself whether  it  is necessary  to
make it private.  Unless there is  some  particular reason  that  everyone
shouldn't know what you're  saying,  don't make  it private.  We don't call
them PUBLIC bulletin boards  for nothing, folks.  It's very irritating to other
callers when there are huge blank spots in the messages that they can't read
and  it stifles interaction between callers.
 
9.   If  your favorite BBS has a time limit, observe it.   If  it doesn't, set
a limit for yourself and abide by it instead.  Don't tie up a system until it
finally kicks you off and then call back with  another  name.  This same rule
applies  to  downloading  or playing  games.  Only one person at a time can be
logged on to  a BBS  and  it  isn't fair to everyone else if  you  overstay
your welcome.  Remember, a BBS is best when it can be left wide  open.  If you
try and cheat the rules you just hurt everybody by forcing the  Sysop  to adopt
more strigent policies.  I can't  count  the number of systems that are now
locked tighter than a drum because of people who cheat and abuse.
 
10.   Don't  call  a BBS just to look at the list  of  other  BBS numbers.
Most especially don't call a system as a new user  and run  right  to the other
numbers list.  There  is  probably  very little  that's more annoying to any
Sysop than to have his  board completely passed over by you on your way to
another board.
 
11.  Have the common courtesy to pay attention to what passes  in front  of
your face.  When a BBS displays your name and asks  "Is this you?", don't say
yes when you can see perfectly well that it is  mispelled.  Also, don't start
asking questions  about  simple operation  of a system until you have
thouroghly read all of  the instructions  that  are available to you.  I assure
you  that  it isn't  any fun to answer a question for the thousandth time  when
the  answer is prominently displayed in the system  bulletins  or instructions.
Use some common sense when you ask your questions.  The person who said
"There's no such thing as a stupid  question" obviously never operated a BBS.
 
12.   If by some chance you should encounter an error  while  you are  online
(Heaven forbid!), ALWAYS take the time to  leave  the Sysop  a  message
describing the circumstances.  Don't  just  say "There was an error".  That is
not helpful in the least.  Chances are  that he knows there was an error.  What
he needs to know  is what  you were doing when the error occurred so that he
can  have some chance of finding and correcting it.  If the error  happened
after you input something, tell him what it was.  Remember that a BBS can't
improve unless you're willing to help.
 
13.  Don't be personally abusive.  It doesn't matter whether  you like a Sysop
or think he's a jerk.  The fact remains that he  has a large investment in
making his computer available, usually  out of  the goodness of his heart.  If
you don't like a Sysop or  his system,  just remember that you can change the
channel  any  time you  want.  Calling a Sysop names or making  uninformed
comments about his lifestyle only shows you for the child you really are.
 
14.   Keep  firmly in mind that you are a guest on  any  BBS  you happen  to
call.  Don't think of logging on as one of your  basic human  rights.  Every
person that has ever put a computer  system online  for the use of other people
has spent a lot of  time  and money  to  do so.  While he doesn't expect
nonstop  pats  on  the back,  it  seems reasonable that he should at least  be
able  to expect fair treatment from his callers.  This includes  following any
of the rules for system use he has laid out without  grumping about  it.
Every  Sysop has his own idea of how  he  wants  his system  to  be run.  It is
really none of your  business  why  he wants  to  run it the way he does.  Your
business  is  to  either abide by what he says, or call some other BBS where
you feel that you can obey the rules.

                                ***************
 
We've sen a lot of boards with great potential that don't live up to their
promise because of sysop laziness.  So, here's what the contributors to PIRATE
see as a good board:
 
1. The files are well organized into sections or topics so you don't have to
hunt for everything. TAKE NOTE SYSOPS!! You shouldn't have to search all files
to find the telecom program you're looking for.
 
2. There is a wildcard function so files can be found between directories and
uploaders can quickly check for duplicates by typing a "S" or "F" and then, if
looking for a program called first choice, the keyword "CHOI*.*" We especially
like TELEGARD.
 
3. A good board should support 9600 or higher.
 
4. Users should not be allowed in at 300, and even 1200 should be discouraged.
 
5. Programs *MUST BE* complete, properly labeled (to include version), and
sorted in some coherent fashion.
 
6. The users should not be lamerz who upload junk for upload credits and users
should participate regularly in message sections. Most users on good boards
call long distance and can't afford to hang out on message bases for too long.
The way around this is to capture message logs and respond after logging up by
tying out the responses and then uploading the ascii text as a message
response the next time logging on.
 
6. Sysops *MUST* be friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to put the files in
order, change descriptions, and weed out good/bad users.  Sysops should also
be patient and help nurture novices.
 
7. Batch up/down loading should be available, and so should bimodem.

REVIEW OF:  EURO-AMERICAN CONNECTION (708) 296-0242 (Chicago Suburbs)
----------
 
GENE:  Hey, Rog' -- here's a new board, just started up in December, and I
       think it has the potential to be one of the best boards in the country.
       You go in at 9600 and get 1550+ CPS, all the warez on on-line, and they
       all work. Can't beat that. You've seen the nearly 1 gig of space, and
       there's plans to go multi line. The users are a nice mix of
       instate/outstate. We've both read the message logs, and even you agree
       that there's not a lamer in the bunch. The files are well ad says, it's
       sure about the friendliest board I've been on. If you're having
       problems, Hot Mix is usually around to help, and he doesn't hide like a
       lot of sysops do.  And I like the feature that *ALL* users only get 60
       minutes a day, not counting upload time, and that time returned for
       uploads is a straight one-to-one. Keeps users from hogging or from
       uploading garbage just for more time. And don't forget that HST
       14,400!! One meg in 10 minutes!
 
ROGER: I dunno, Gene. I've seen lots of new boards, even good ones, come and
       go, and too often they don't live up to their promise. The sysops get
       lazy, the good users upload all their stuff, mooch what they can, then
       move on. You're NAIVETE amazes me! Yeh, yeh, the messages are good, but
       they're mostly about prolems with warez.  I personally like the
       occasional flame and political discussion, and I didn't see any of that
       there. I agree that all the fixin's are there for a super board, but
       we'll see what it looks like in a year. But I'll admit that it's one of
       the best new ones I've seen, and in just looking a file dates, it looks
       like people are putting stuff up consistently.
 
GENE:  You're just jaded because Stealth went down and Berserker is still at
       2400. C'mon! You *know* in your heart of hearts this is a darn good
       board. And you can't beat the small user's fee--just a couple of bucks
       a month--to store backup copies of stuff. And have you ever seen such a
       generous u/d-load ratio as five-to-one?
 
ROGER: Look, I'm not knocking the board. But I've just seen to many fast
       starts and quick stumbles.  If Hot Mix and the users can keep it up,
       I'll eat my words. I hope they do. I'll even call it. I'll bet you
       didn't know that the sysop's handle, "hot mix," is from his DJ days as
       a hot mixer of records, did you?
 -----RATING:  -----
    GENE:  An enthusiastic 10!! THIS IS A GREAT BOARD!
    ROGER: Yeh, ok, I'll concede. I give it a 9+ -- but ask me again next year
 
Here's what you see when you look on, Rog' -- there's lots of different areas
and something for everybody. It's running TELEGARD, and that's about the
hottest sysem around right now, and when 3.0 comes out, nothing will touch
it!!

 Title: 386 and an Epson lq1000
     >> This message has 1 reply
 
Can ANYONE help me on this:
I had an IBM (True Blue) XT with an Epson LQ1000 which worked fine all of the
time. Well now I have upgraded to a 386 and when I plugged in my epson and try
to print anything all I get is alot of $ > mixed into the file and it doesnt
even look like the file I am trying to print. Can anyone help me out to get
this working properly? Is there anything you have to include in the
config.sys/autoexec.bat to get the printer to recognise the files properly?
Thanks alot to anyone for any help.......I will try anything to get it to work
with the 386.

    First of all, is the printer serial or parallel? (or both), if u are using
the parallel setup, the u might want start by checking your cables on a diff
machine (but u said it worked on your xt, so that's not the culprit), second,
if it is parallel setup, u want to try slowing your cpu down (if your computer
allows it.....the computer could be shooting out the data too fast, and
there's not enuf time to do handshaking, so you're getting shit printer
out)...if it's serial, make sure your serial port is set at the same baud rate
as the printer is....if it is, make sure u'r cable has its handshaking signal
enabled (make sure the cable is wired properly).....(the first thing i would
try is slowing the computer down, cuz high speeds usually do cause errors
(especially at 33 MHZ!!!))
